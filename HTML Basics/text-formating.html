        and analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect.</br>Historians 
        often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different 
        causes and effects. Historians also debate the nature of history as an end in itself, as well 
        as its usefulness to give perspective on the problems of the present</p>
